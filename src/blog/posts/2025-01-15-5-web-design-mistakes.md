Your website is often the first impression potential customers have of your business. Unfortunately, many small businesses make critical design mistakes that drive visitors away before they even read your content.

Here are the five most common mistakes I see—and how to fix them:

## 1. Slow Loading Times

If your website takes more than 3 seconds to load, you're losing customers. Studies show that 40% of visitors abandon sites that take longer than 3 seconds.

**Quick fix:** Optimize your images and choose a reliable hosting provider.

## 2. Poor Mobile Experience

Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. If your site doesn't work well on phones, you're missing most of your audience.

**Quick fix:** Use responsive design that adapts to all screen sizes.

## 3. Unclear Value Proposition

Visitors should understand what you do within 5 seconds of landing on your site. If they're confused, they'll leave.

**Quick fix:** Add a clear headline that explains your main benefit.

## 4. Too Many Choices

When faced with too many options, people often choose nothing. This is called "choice paralysis."

**Quick fix:** Limit your main navigation to 5-7 items maximum.

## 5. Missing Contact Information

Make it easy for customers to reach you. Hidden contact info suggests you don't want to hear from them.

**Quick fix:** Add your phone number and email to your header or footer.
