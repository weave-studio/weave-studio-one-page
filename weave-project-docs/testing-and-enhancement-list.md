## ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Polish Later)

### Design & UX
- [ ] **Hero padding**: Too much padding on top and bottom
- [ ] **Trust signals**: Unclear what these represent - need better content
- [ ] **Image overlay**: About section overlay effect needs refinement
- [ ] **Mobile scroll indicator**: Consider hiding on mobile devices
- [ ] **Button hover states**: 'View Our Work' button hover exit animation in light mode
- [ ] **Scroll positioning**: Better target positioning when scrolling to sections

### Accessibility & Standards (Need Verification)
- [ ] **Screen reader testing**: Text rotator announcements
- [ ] **ARIA labels**: Scroll indicator and interactive elements
- [ ] **Focus management**: Tab order and visual focus indicators
- [ ] **Reduced motion**: Verify CSS animations respect user preferences
- [ ] **Color contrast**: WCAG compliance verification
- [ ] **Alt text**: All images need descriptive alt attributes
- [ ] **Fixed header offset**: Smooth scrolling calculation accuracy

## üö® Critical Issues (Fix Before Phase B3)

### 1. Text Rotator RTL Positioning
**Status**: Hebrew text cuts off at beginning instead of end
**Impact**: Core bilingual functionality compromised
**Priority**: High

**Issues**:
- Hebrew text rotator positioning incorrect (RTL vs LTR)
- Text gets cut off at wrong end in Hebrew
- Container alignment doesn't adapt to text direction

**Required Fix**:
```css
/* Add RTL support for Hebrew */
.lang-he .text-rotator {
  text-align: right;
}

.lang-he .text-rotator__item {
  left: auto;
  right: 0;
}
```

### 2. Performance Regression  
**Status**: Lighthouse score dropped to 68 (from 79)
**Impact**: LCP increased 1.6s, TBT increased 220ms
**Priority**: Medium (defer to Phase B6)

**Specific Issues**:
- LCP: 4.0s ‚Üí 5.6s (major regression) 
- TBT: 30ms ‚Üí 250ms (JavaScript blocking)
- CLS: 0 ‚Üí 0.027 (new layout shift)

**Likely Causes**:
- RTL CSS changes introducing layout shifts
- JavaScript execution conflicts
- CSS recalculation overhead

**Action**: Address in Phase B6 performance optimization

---

## Fix Priority Recommendations

### Before Moving to Phase B3:
1. **Revert text rotator** to basic fade transition
2. **Test bilingual functionality** thoroughly
3. **Performance audit** and optimization
4. **Quick accessibility check** (ARIA labels, alt text)

### Phase B3+ Polish Items:
1. Hero section spacing refinement
2. Enhanced button animations
3. Screen reader testing
4. Comprehensive accessibility audit
5. Advanced typing effect (if desired)

## üé® Phase B6 Design Enhancement List

### Services Section Redesign
**Status**: Phase B3 complete - functionality working
**Current**: Gradient backgrounds, large cards with icons, CTA buttons
**Desired**: Cleaner, more minimal aesthetic to match modern design preferences
**Priority**: Medium - defer to Phase B6 visual polish phase

**Planned Improvements**:
- [ ] Simplified card layouts without heavy gradients
- [ ] More subtle hover effects and micro-interactions
- [ ] Refined typography and spacing
- [ ] Cleaner icon presentation
- [ ] Better visual hierarchy

### Overall Visual Refinements
- [ ] Consistent spacing system across all sections
- [ ] Enhanced color palette refinements
- [ ] Improved button and interaction design
- [ ] Professional image placeholder replacements
- [ ] Typography fine-tuning for better readability

---

## Quick Fix Implementation

### Text Rotator Revert (Immediate)
```css
/* Replace complex typing animations with simple fade */
.text-rotator__item {
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease-out;
  opacity: 0;
}

.text-rotator__item.is-active {
  opacity: 1;
}
```

### Performance Quick Wins
- Remove unused CSS animations
- Simplify JavaScript rotator logic
- Optimize image loading
- Defer non-critical scripts

### Bilingual Testing Script
```javascript
// Test language switching
window.switchLanguage('he'); // Test Hebrew
window.switchLanguage('en'); // Test English
// Verify text rotator works in both
```

---

## Success Criteria for Phase B3 Readiness

- [ ] Text rotator working in both English and Hebrew
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score 80+
- [ ] No critical accessibility violations
- [ ] Smooth scrolling and navigation functional
- [ ] All CTAs and interactive elements working

**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-3 hours
**Recommended Approach**: Focus on core functionality over visual polish
